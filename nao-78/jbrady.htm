<p><font size=+1>Dear Mr. Secretary:</font>
<p><font size=+1>I am writing you to submit my resignation from the Foreign
Service of the United States and from my position as political counselor
in US Embassy Athens, effective March 7. I do so with a heavy heart. The
baggage of my upbringing included a felt obligation to give something back
to my country. Service as a US diplomat was a dream job. I was paid to
understand foreign languages and cultures, to seek out diplomats, politicians,
scholars, and journalists, and to persuade them that US interests and theirs
fundamentally coincided. My faith in my country and its values was the
most powerful weapon in my diplomatic arsenal.</font>
<p><font size=+1>It is inevitable that during twenty years with the State
Department I would become more sophisticated and cynical about the narrow
and selfish bureaucratic motives that sometimes shaped our policies. Human
nature is what it is, and I was rewarded and promoted for understanding
human nature. But until this administration it had been possible to believe
that by upholding the policies of my president I was also upholding the
interests of the American people and the world. I believe it no longer.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The policies we are now asked to advance are incompatible
not only with American values but also with American interests. Our fervent
pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us to squander the international legitimacy
that has been America's most potent weapon of both offense and defense
since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle the largest
and most effective web of international relationships the world has ever
known. Our current course will bring instability and danger, not security.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The sacrifice of global interests to domestic politics
and to bureaucratic self-interest is nothing new, and it is certainly not
a uniquely American problem. Still, we have not seen such systematic distortion
of intelligence, such systematic manipulation of American opinion, since
the war in Vietnam. The September 11 tragedy left us stronger than before,
rallying around us a vast international coalition to cooperate for the
first time in a systematic way against the threat of terrorism. But rather
than take credit for those successes and build on them, this administration
has chosen to make terrorism a domestic political tool, enlisting a scattered
and largely defeated al-Qaeda as its bureaucratic ally. We spread disproportionate
terror and confusion in the public mind, arbitrarily linking the unrelated
problems of terrorism and Iraq. The result, and perhaps the motive, is
to justify a vast misallocation of shrinking public wealth to the military
and to weaken the safeguards that protect American citizens from the heavy
hand of government. September 11 did not do as much damage to the fabric
of American society as we seem determined to do to ourselves. Is the Russia
of the late Romanovs really our model, a selfish, superstitious empire
thrashing toward self-destruction in the name of a doomed status quo?</font>
<p><font size=+1>We should ask ourselves why we have failed to persuade
more of the world that a war with Iraq is necessary. We have over the past
two years done too much to assert to our world partners that narrow and
mercenary US interests override the cherished values of our partners. Even
where our aims are not in question, our consistency is at issue. The model
of Afghanistan is little comfort to allies wondering on what basis we plan
to rebuild the Middle East, and in whose image and interests. Have we indeed
become blind, as Russia is blind in Chechnya, as Israel is blind in the
Occupied Territories, to our own advice, that overwhelming military power
is not the answer to terrorism? After the shambles of postwar Iraq joins
the shambles in Grozny and Ramallah, it will be a brave foreigner who forms
ranks with Micronesia to follow where we lead.</font>
<p><font size=+1>We have a coalition still, a good one. The loyalty of
many of our friends is impressive, a tribute to American moral capital
built up over a century. But our closest allies are persuaded less that
war is justified than that it would be perilous to allow the US to drift
into complete solipsism. Loyalty should be reciprocal. Why does our president
condone the swaggering and contemptuous approach to our friends and allies
this administration is fostering, including among its most senior officials?
Has oderint dum metuant really become our motto?</font>
<p><font size=+1>I urge you to listen to America's friends around the world.
Even here in Greece, purported hotbed of European anti-Americanism, we
have more and closer friends than the American newspaper reader can possibly
imagine. Even when they complain about American arrogance, Greeks know
that the world is a difficult and dangerous place, and they want a strong
international system with the US and the EU in close partnership. When
our friends are afraid of us rather than for us, it is time to worry. And
now they are afraid. Who will tell them convincingly that the United States
is as it was, a beacon of liberty, security, and justice for the planet?</font>
<p><font size=+1>Mr. Secretary, I have enormous respect for your character
and ability. You have preserved more international credibility for us than
our policy deserves, and salvaged something positive from the excesses
of an ideological and self-serving administration. But your loyalty to
the President goes too far. We are straining beyond its limits an international
system we built with such toil and treasure, a web of laws, treaties, organizations,
and shared values that sets limits on our foes far more effectively than
it ever constrained America's ability to defend its interests.</font>
<p><font size=+1>I am resigning because I have tried and failed to reconcile
my conscience with my ability to represent the current US administration.
I have confidence that our democratic process is ultimately self-correcting,
and hope that in a small way I can contribute from outside to shaping policies
that better serve the security and prosperity of the American people and
the world we share.</font>
